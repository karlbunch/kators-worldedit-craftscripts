Kator's MineCraft CraftScripts
==============================

Scripts I've written for minecraft bukkit servers with worldedit installed

You need to have a working copy of Rhino on the server.

Install the scripts in your {minecraft-server-path}/plugins/WorldEdit/craftscripts directory.

See: http://wiki.sk89q.com/wiki/WorldEdit/Scripting for details on setting up your server to run craftscripts.
